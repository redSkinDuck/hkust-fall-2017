Berlin's positive/negative freedom
  - negative from absence of constrainst
  - Hobbes' arugement: Too much freedom (state of nature), gotta use law to discoursge people from doing it
  - unlimited negative freedom leads to chaos
  - unlimited negative freedom also described as no freedom at all because others can freely violate one's negative freedom
  - too much limitation on negative freedom leads to totalitarian though

Positive liberty
  - master of one's own mind, wholly internal
  - requires one to go through the trouble to gain the ability to choose (which might means limitation on negative freedom)
    (e.g. learn piano so one has the liberty to do it, given that I chose to do it)
  - requires cultivation ("I may be coerced for my own good which I am too blind to see")

Coercion
  - as in prevented from attaining a goal by human beings
  - not in what we physically can't do (e.g. jump 10 feets high in the air)
