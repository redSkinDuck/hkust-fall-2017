Hobbes' argument on state of nature to social contract
  - state of nature
    - 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short'
    - hovering in human
    - emerges when social contract fails to put one in awe
  - to impose a fear of punishment of a violation
  - a third party should be responsible for carrying out the punishment
    - 'keep them all in awe'
    - to collect all power of retaliation
    - thus, violator shouldn't be tempted to retaliate on your own retaliation
    - a strong form of government from the sense of Hobbes' work
    - !(personally) as long as it keeps everybody in awe I guess it works
  - against one's own retaliation
    - no better than state of nature for self-perservation
    - the weak have no power to retaliate
  - 'I authorize and give up my right of governing...'
    - state of nature/social contract is a personal condition, of choice
    - authorization happens when one abides by the law
    - one can always fall back to state of nature by ignoring the law ('there is no law/just/unjust')

Benefit of social contract
  - safety, community
  - free from the need to retaliate or the risk of being retaliated excessively

Fallacy of begging the question
  - 'lastly, animals are naturally social whereas human request artificial agreement'
