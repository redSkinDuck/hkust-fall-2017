Risks of shorting
  - unable to borrow
  - could lose an infinite amount because the price can go all the way up
    - whereas in long you lose only 100% of your investment
    - short squeeze
      - gotta face with margin call asking for more collateral
      - even if it goes down in the long run, marign call will force to close the position
        if not enough collateral
  - "mother of all short squeezes"

  - no need to buy back (cover the position) after bankruptcy
    - bank still could call back, then you need to buy it back
    - realize capital gain (buy back at $0.000001) at the point of buy back, which will be taxed

Expected return
  - given SD=15%, avg=10% per year
  - 95% CI = [10% - 1.96 x SD, 10% + 1.96 x SD]
  - 25 year expected return = 1.1^25 - 1 (compound)
    or, 1.1 x 25 - 1 = 250% (simple)
  - ? 25 year expected volatility = sqrt(25) x 15% = 75% ? why sqrt
  - 95% CI in 25 years = [100%, 400%]
    - better than 1 year
    - kinda neat
    - prefer long term investment over day-to-day trade
    - bigger risk too (4 times the change)

Value at Risk
  - ? useful for bond more
  - assume normal distribution
  - 5th percentile
  - only 5% probability the return is less than this
  - 90% CI
  - regardless of the distribution
    - can just discount 5% from the left, and from the right
    - that's the 5th percentile
  - if 3 bonds have 99% of 1% return and 1% of -100% return
    - they are all 1%, so no default
    - if use SD of realized return before any would have went down, SD is 0%
    - still may go down at any time, SD is a bad measure for bond in this way

Not sure why he talks about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)
