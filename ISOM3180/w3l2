Switch collision
  - layer 2 device
  - http://vishalp-network.blogspot.hk/2010/05/switches.html
  - dynamic MAC address table
    - flood when no such entry
    - http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2339639&seqNum=3
    - learn about port and MAC address from source whenever a source communicates
  - create collision-free environment
    - dedicated path (one port to one end device)
    - full duplex: send/receive collision
    - memory buffering: simultaneous send/receive = congestion
  - microsegmentation
    - one port, one device
  - ? would network of multiple switches work (switch to switch) without the need of a router?
    - ? does one switch MAC address table contains MAC address to other switches? (otherwise, how to route)
    - ! will talk about towards the end of the course (class?
    - communicate from one network to somewhere far away

Hub collision
  - layer 1 device
  - may not have dedicated path, full duplex, or memory buffering
  - collision happens at path to the device

Router
  - layer 3 device
  - connection between routers are called serial interface
    - http://fschub.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/router-Cisco-rear-panel.jpg
    - http://www.dantraknet.com/ebay/WIC2T.jpg
  - only filtering and forwarding
    - don't flood
    - discard if router does not contain the dest IP in IP table
    - IP is assigned once an end device connects
  - use routing protocol to complete IP table (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_protocol)
    - configured by admin

MAC addres
  - 24 + 24 = 48 bits
  - in hexadecimal numbers (4 bit x 6 x 2)
    - 00-05-9A-3C-78-00
    - 00:05:9A:3C:78:00
    - 0005.9A3C.7800
  - Organizationally unique identifier (OUI)
    - IEEE assigned to each vendor (must use)
  - Vendor assigned number
    - unique per OUI for each NIC

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)
  - multiple devices connected via one media
  - less optimal
  - avoid collision
  - fallback even if collision happens
  1. wait for silence in the media (Carrier Sense (the media))
  2. send and wait for collision (Multiple Access)
  3. done if no collision happens
  4. senders sense the collision, stop sneding data, send jamming signal (32 bits of 1s and 0s)
     - jamming signal won't collide
     - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-sense_multiple_access_with_collision_detection#Jam_signal
  5. all devices set semi-random back-off timer
  6. repeat when the device's timer expires
