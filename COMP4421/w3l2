FFT
  - low frequency components: rough shape of things
  - high frequency components: details, sharp edges

Image power
  - Amount of power a filter 'encloses' (taken as 1 in ideal filter, anything outside the region is taken as 0)
  - Computed using the real and imaginary components R(u,v)^2 + I(u, v)^2
  - Power percentage with respect to toal power image Pt
  - Lower power, less high frequency components, blurrier image

Ideal filter
  - step function
  - ringing artifacts due to sinc function with high frequency components missing (less sharp edges)

Butterworth filters
  - smoother cut off
  - higher power n, sharper cut off (try taking derivative in p.44)
  - changing n alone will make it more steep, thus creating ripple effect like ideal filter
  - coefficient a (alpha) less than 1 can make the curve smoother
    - a increases, slope is smaller and H at cut off frequency is decreasing
    - like pushing the curve down, see p.46

Gaussian lowpass filter
  - D0 as in variance in a distribution, higher D0, wider curve and less steep in *frequency domain* (see p.50)
  - p.51 you can convert this gaussian filter in frequency domain into a filter in spacial domain
  - standard deviation is inversely proportional to the cut off frequency D0 in *spacial domain* (p.52)
  - their effect are opposite (SD and D0)
  - for higher SD in spacial domain, it represents averaging with higher structuring element size
  - the same effect is achieved in frequency domain with lower D0 (higher SD lower D0), in which high frequency
    information are omitted, giving a blurrier image
  - examples show darker image border because of zero padding, this effect can be removed using mirroring

High pass filter
  - high pass filter = 1 - low pass filter (in frequency domain)

Rayleigh noise
  - favors positive side because the noise is taken from magnitude of a vector (x, y)
    - M = sqrt(x^2 + y^2), which is always positive, and x, y corrupted by noise
  - em method (check!) /mean + variance methods (set up two equations) in one region to find a and b
